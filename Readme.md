# Pixel Jump

HTML 2D vertical scroller game. Meant for desktop; audio and canvas filters are not working on iOS Safari (probably other mobile browsers), so the game doesn't really work on mobile. For the canvas filter issues, see this PR:

https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/3793

That being said, I have implemented on-screen controls for mobile browsers if these issues are ever resolved.
